## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project simulates the operation of an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging system connected to a household. It uses a simulated server (via Flask) that responds to JSON requests and allows a Python-based client application to manage battery charging intelligently based on two strategies:

- **Load-based Mode**: Charges when household load is below 11 kW.
- **Price-based Mode**: Charges when electricity price is among the lowest 8 hours of the day.

---

## Features Implemented

- REST API communication with a simulated EV charging station
- Discharges battery to 20% before simulation
- Supports both **load** and **price** based charging strategies
- Simulated time: 1 hour = 2 seconds
- Logs data in `charging_log.txt` (full terminal log) and `battery_log.csv` (summary table)
- Tracks:

* Simulated hour
* Base load
* Electricity price
* Battery % charge
* Charging status

  **CSV plot** of battery charge level over time  
  Daily statistics such as total charged hours

## Results Summary (Last Simulation)

- **Total Charging Time**: 8 hours
- **Initial Battery %**: 20.00
- **Final Battery %**: 83.93

## Graph Example

Battery percentage increased during simulation. Refer to `battery_plot.png`.

> **Tip:** You can open `battery_log.csv` in Excel or Numbers for detailed filtering or analysis.

## How to Run

1. Run the simulated server (once):

```bash
python charging_simulation.py
```

2. In another terminal, run the client app:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Choose your mode when prompted: `load` or `price`.
